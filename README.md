<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
 ## Project Unit-1  (Rick And Morty )

The project of Rick and Morty is displaying the images and names from API and doing some functions.


## Functionalities in the website:

There are some functions that used  for this project :

 1-search:
  there are many names in options that will display on the screen you can select any of them and it will display the image and name for the option that you selected.

2-Add  :
you can also add a new image and name, to add it to your cards.

 3-Read or See more:
if you want to know more information about the card, there is a link under each image you can click and see more information.

4-Remove :
if you don't like some card on the list there is an icon under the image (trash) you can click it to remove the card.


 ## Tools used:

1-CSS for styling website.

2-Trello: Project management tool to organize the time and work.

3-Figma: Wireframing that's helped me to design my website before jumping into coding

## Problem encountered:

Choosing the API: It took me one day while searching and trying more than one API to get the appropriate API, and then I choice Rick And Morty data API because there are many reactions on the faces in the images., so I liked that.
Find good design: In fact, I have no experience in designing interfaces, but I tried to make the user interface simple and easy to use, and Figma helped me with that.
build functions because I don't have experience, it's taken a long time
